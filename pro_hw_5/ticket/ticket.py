# 2. Write a program for selling tickets to IT-events. Each ticket has a unique number and a price.
# There are four types of tickets: regular ticket, advance ticket (purchased 60 or more days before
# the event), late ticket (purchased fewer than 10 days before the event) and student ticket.
# Additional information:
# -advance ticket - discount 40% of the regular ticket price;
# -student ticket - discount 50% of the regular ticket price;
# -late ticket - additional 10% to the regular ticket price.
# All tickets must have the following properties:
# -the ability to construct a ticket by number;
# -the ability to ask for a ticketâ€™s price;
# -the ability to print a ticket as a String.
